/*
This module contains the pricing for message types as constants.

Pricing in Swarm is defined as an internal unit (called `honey`).
Honey acts as a unit of relative message pricing; that is,
it allows setting prices relative to message types, irrespective of a reference currency.

The expectation is then that an external, probably on-chain, **oracle**
would be queried with the total amount of honey for a message,
for which the oracle would return the price in a given currency.

Currently the expected currency from the oracle would be wei,
but it could potentially be any currency the oracle and Swarm support,
allowing for a multi-currency design.
